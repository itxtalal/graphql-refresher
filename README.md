This repository is a simple commits based learning or refresher of GraphQL API design using Apollo server.


## Overview

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing function resolvers for each field on each type.
